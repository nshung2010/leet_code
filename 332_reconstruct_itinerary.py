"""
Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and
arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All
of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the
itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:

If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary
that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
 For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical
 order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
Example 1:

Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
Example 2:

Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.
